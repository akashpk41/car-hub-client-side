- Technologies used in this website `Tailwind CSS` `React` `React Router-v6` `Firebase` `Node js` `Express js` `MongoDB` `JWT (json web token)`

# Main Features

- In this `Car Hub` website there are `Navbar` `Banner` `Inventory Items` `Popular Brands` `About` `Contact` `Blogs` `Add Items` `My Items` and `Manage Items` sections are available

- Users can see inventory items blogs contact and about pages.

- `Add Items` `My Items` and ` Manage Items` page are private that's mean only registered user can see that page

* I am implemented a Login system by Firebase 9 . Users can log in with their `Google` Account.

* Also user can Create New Account with their `Email` and `Password`

* In the private route page if the user's email is not verified yet he/she can't see that page, when he/she will create a new account, automatically a verification email will be sent to their email.

* If a verification email is not sent User can send it manually.

* In the `Manage Items` page user can see all of inventory items.

* There is a `Add New Items` section where user can add their own inventory item by items name, price, image and etc information

* And on the `My Items` page user can view all of the inventory items data that the user added. And there is a delete button he/she can delete it from that page

* I implemented `JWT` (json web token) for secure API . When the user will be login it is automatically generate.

* if users have a valid token then only user can see their data on my items page

* And finally this is my first `MERN STACK` project. I used Tailwind CSS to make the website responsive.
  for making good looking UI I used `React`. ` Node` and `Express js` for creating the server and is used `MongoDB` as a database for storing user and all inventory items data.
